    <p>I am a second year graduate student at the University of Florida working towards a Masters of Arts in Mass Communication with a specialization in public relations. Originally from Colorado, I received my undergraduate degree from Virginia Wesleyan College with a double major in Communication and Recreation & Leisure Studies while playing four years of lacrosse.</p>
    <p>Majoring in communications wasn't always my plan. I didn't go into college declared as a communications major, but I was enrolled in both a journalism course and media history course my second semester of freshman year and became so intrigued. Not soon after, I declared communications as a double major. Being a double major in school, there were quite a few classes I didn't have an opportunity to take in communications. I was eager to expand my knowledge and spend more time focusing on this field as I have a deep passion for all things communications related.</p>
    <p>Some of my experience includes creating strategic public relations plans, managing social media, developing marketing plans, writing press releases and other articles, writing and delivering speeches, conducting research studies, creating fund raising campaigns, and developing creative material.</p>
    <p><strong>On a personal level</strong></p>

        <ul>
<li>Being from Colorado, I'm a mountain girl. I love exploring and experiencing the outdoors.</li>
<li>I'm from Colorado, went to undergrad in Virginia, and now live in Florida. I get plenty of weird looks and am asked a lot of questions, I guess I just like to explore!</li>
<li>I played lacrosse in college and it was definitely the best four years of my life.</li>
<li>I am the oldest of four kids and am an extremely proud big sister.</li>
<li>I love traveling. I grew up spending summers going to Yellowstone and Mount Rushmore so I appreciate the opportunity to go to new places.</li>
