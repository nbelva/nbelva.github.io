    <h2>About</h2> 
    <p>I am a second year graduate student at the University of Florida. I am working towards a Masters of Arts in Mass Communication with a specialization in public relations. I received my undergraduate degree from Virginia Wesleyan College with a double major in Communication and Recreation & Leisure Studies. In my time at Wesleyan, academic highlights included being a Dean's list and All-Conference Academic Award recipient, receiving the Communications Outstanding Student Award, being the Humanities Division Undergraduate Research Award Recipient, and earning 2nd place in Continuing Coverage by the Society for Collegiate Journalists. I was involved in three honor societies, two of which I held officer positions in.</p>
    
<p>I love learning everything regarding mass media. I have a passion for it and it makes sense to me. I specifically enjoy looking at strategic processes and being a part of planning. Over the course of my school work, I've completed numerous internships which have given me valuable experience in the field. </p>
    
<h3>On a personal level</h3>
<ul>
<li>I'm originally from Colorado- I always get asked why I went from Colorado to Virginia to Florida- I guess I just like to explore!</li>
<li>I played lacrosse in college- it gave me the best memories and best friends I could ever ask for</li>
<li>I am the oldest of four kids and am an extremely proud big sister</li>
<li>I'm a total foodie- I love tasting new things, trying out local spots, and spending time in the kitchen</li>
<li>I love traveling- I grew up spending summers going to Yellowstone and Mount Rushmore so I appreciate the opportunity to go to new places.</li>
        </ul>
