    <p>Professor Spiker sat down with me to discuss his course and sports media as a whole.</p>
    <p>Spiker has been teaching Sports Media & Society for four years. When asked what prompted the idea for the course, Spiker said,"We were looking at ways that we could develop a class that had a mass appeal not to just our major but also majors across the campus."</p>
    <p>"It just hit me, what has mass appeal and how can we get that out to a lot of people and sports media seemed to be a perfect subject."</p>
    <p>According to Spiker, sports media is in a "bigger spotlight than ever before." Not only does sports media expose the joys and ups and downs of sports, but also "now more than ever sports media exposes greater issues." Spiker mentioned Jason Collins, who recently spoke out on being gay, and Bob Costas bringing up gun control during a sport broadcast.</p>

<p>Sports media allows for amazing and incredible stories to be told in a way that can relate to a mass audience. Touching on the story and thematic elements, Spiker noted, "Sports serves the perfect backdrop for a narrative. We have an ending, characters, a protagonist, and then we have a lot of strong elements of storytelling." We spoke about the role that sports plays in times of tragedy, such as the JFK assassination and 9-11. "Obviously sports gives a little bit of escape that you can focus your attention on," said Spiker, "but I think its more than that because of the narrative elements. In a really genuine way, we get to see triumph. I think that's important when a nation is going through tragedy."
    
<p><i>"On the surface yes, it's about the ups and downs of sports but theres a lot of stuff beyond the score" -Ted Spiker</i></p>

<p>Spiker touched on issues such as access and privacy in sports media noting that we are able to get so much sports in such depth, "but you wonder where the limit is." Spiker doesn't anticipate a drop in the role of sports media and its coverage because consumer dollars support it and it provides benefits for the athlete and the organization that often outweigh any negatives.</p>
