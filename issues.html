        <h4>Women</h4>

        <p>From a professional standpoint, women have had to face a significant amount of adversity in order to achieve success. Just a mere 10% of sports journalists are women, and early stereotypes on women in the profession were extremely negative, as they were often referred to as groupies. While many women have made phenomenal careers in the sports media field, notable incidents involving athletes or other professionals have plauged the image. In 1990, Lisa Olson was reportedly approached by Zeke Mowatt as he stood naked in the locker room and the organization's owner then said that she was "asking for it." Olson was harassed by the public to the point where she received death threats, leading to her moving out of the country. In 2010, Hannah Storm was attacked by colleague Tony Kornheiser for being in an outfit that made her look like a sausage. Ines Sainz was a former TV Azteca reporter for the New York Jets. During her sideline reporting, she was receiving catcalls from players and was having footballs thrown in her direction. Women are stuck in a double-bind. In order to join the boys, they have to be attractive, but their attractiveness becomes their own fault. The small number of incidents unfortunately reflects the majority perception. Female reporters are also limited to sideline reporting. Even though NFL games have an audience of 44% women, female reporter stick to the sidelines, often commenting on halftime reports and injury updates.</p>

        <h4>Privacy</h4>
        <p>Athlete privacy is a common topic in sports media. The debate on how much is too much and what details should be kept private to the athlete and/or organization remains a tough line to draw. Scandals break within minutes, often shattering an athlete's image and an organization's reputation. We see with the case of Johnny Manziel that some athletes don't want to be suffocated by media. Manziel would post pictures and behave as most college students do, but was scrutinized for his behavior when pictures when viral. While athletes do sign professional contracts and are competiting for entertainment purposes, they deamnd privacy rights too.</p>
        
        <h4>Money</h4>
        <p>The media business is all about whether or not the audience should pay for content. Even if you aren't paying directly, you might be paying indirectly. Superbowl ads cost 3.5 million dollars in 2012 for just a 30 second spot. Media makes money from subscribers, advertisers, and consumers. Higher circulation prodcuts demand more advertising dollars for the right to reach more potential customers. Much of sports media is littered with advertisments and cheesy endorsement deals like Lebron James and McDonalds. Athletes cash in on sponsorships and endorsements of those companies than advertise and sometimes make more in sponsorship dollars than their professional salaries. </p>
        
        <h4>ESPN</h4>

        <p>When we think of sports nowadays, ESPN is probably the first thing that comes to mind. Some argue that as the network has grown, journalistic standards have suffered. In terms of content, there is more dialogue and less news than in previous years. ESPN gives preferential coverage to sports they are affiliated with. ESPN doesn't have NHL rights, so hockey receives little if any coverage. In regards to the Penn State scandal, critics say that ESPN should have been leading charge in reporting on this, but they didn't. The network's relationship with celebrity athletes brings criticisms as well. Hosting "The Decision" with Lebron James and frequent appearances by non-athletes or reporters on ESPN question their credibility. They are known to be charged with plagiarism and lose their strong personalities to competing networks. The ESPN book, which interviewed nearly 500 people reveals some questionable behavior by the network and its employees.</p>
