    <h2>Sports Media and Society</h2>
    <p><strong>As a society, we live and breathe sports. </strong></p>
    <p>Since the evolution of sports coverage in magazines up to today's Twitter world, Americans have made sports a large part of their lives, more importantly, sports media. While most think of ESPN when thinking about the subject, a multitude of mediums exist such as blogs, social media, and advertisements. The sports industry and its relationship with the media is a fascinating one to explore. Sports media has four major functions: <i>news, storytelling, opinion/analysis, and entertainment.</i></p>
        
    <h3>Forms</h3>
        <p>Sports media takes place in many forms-</p>
          <ul>
<li>Newspaper- Offers analysis and opinion</li>
<li>Radio- Play-by-play, fan voice, entertainment talk</li>
<li>TV- <i>Everything</i>, games, highlights, opinions, analysis, news</li>
<li>Magazines- Depth, originality, relevance, personal stories</li>
<li>Photography- Action, still</li> 
<li>Books- Point of view, depth, insight</li>
<li>Digital- Web sites, bloggers, user/fan boards, podcasts</li>
<li>Team Media- Own media of all forms (news, features) with point of view and access</li>
<li>Social Media- Athletes and teams have a voice</li>
        </ul>  
<p>Many are familiar with the basics of media coverage such as the First Amendment, libel, and slander. Sports media coverage differs from other media coverage because a conflict of interest exists.</p>  
<p><strong>The conflict: Getting the "good stuff" (good material) VS. protecting an organization and message</strong></p>
<p>In determining what the media decides to cover, sports media members consider both the audience and  <i>news values</i>. The audience refers to <strong>what</strong> you cover and <strong>how</strong> you cover it. This varies depending on your geography and also your interest (could narrow down by sport/team). News values determine what we cover, and are the characteristics that determine whether and how media organizations cover things. New values include-</p>
<ul>
    <li>Timeliness- Breaking news</li> 
    <li>Proximity- Local, national, international</li>
    <li>Prominence- Prominent athletes get more coverage</li>
    <li>Impact- How much does it affect your audience?</li>
    <li>Uniqueness- Differentiation</li>
    <li>Scale- Game, play-off, championship, certain sport</li>
    <li>Conflict- Arrests, accidents, injuries, fights</li>
    <li>Human Interest- Emotion, drama</li>
    <li>Sensationalism</li>
        </ul>
<p>As media professionals, we tell our audiences what's important, so it's critical to understand these foundations. </p>        

        <h3>History</h3>
    <p>Early sports media was in the form of stories. Reporters would give the news, specific game stories, analysis, questions and answers, features, investigation, opinion columns, and humor/satire. The 1960's served as the golden age of sports writing.</p>
    <p>Notable early sports media contributors include Grantland Rice, known for his poetic and inspirational prose, Red Smith, the first sportswriter to win the Pulitzer for commentary, Sam Lacy, who focused on racial equality in baseball, Dan Jenkins, dubbed the "Greatest Sportswriter in America," Frank Deford, a six time National sportswriter of the year, and Jim Murray, a 14 time sportswriter of the year. Keep in mind these are mostly reporters, the possibilities for careers in sports media has increased exponentially in recent decades. Staff is needed for media relations, community relations, social media management, and sports information among others.</p>
    <p>Television network sports picked up in the 1940's, with a dramatic increase in the 70's and 80's in terms of what networks began to pay leagues for rights to games. At this time, cable networks such as ESPN, HBO, and TBS emerged. Many universities and professional organizations now have their own sort of network that offers exclusive access for a fee. At the University of Florida, Gatorvision/Gatorzone offers coveraged focused on Florida athletics.</p>
    <p>While there are many roles in sports media, the themes of sports and the underlying reasons we care about sports remains the same. Themes include <i>Man vs. Man, Good vs. Self, Man vs. Self, Boy meets Girl, David vs. Goliath, Misfit fits in, Rags to Riches, The Quest- Destination and Journey.</i></p>

        <h3>Professor Spiker</h3>
    <p>Ted Spiker is an associate professor of journalism at the University of Florida. Professor of UF's popular Sports Media and Society course, Spiker was named the college's Teacher of the Year in 2003.</p>
    <p>Professor Spiker sat down with me to discuss his course and sports media as a whole.</p>
    <p>Spiker has been teaching Sports Media & Society for four years. When asked what prompted the idea for the course, Spiker said,"We were looking at ways that we could develop a class that had a mass appeal not to just our major but also majors across the campus."</p>
    <p>"It just hit me, what has mass appeal and how can we get that out to a lot of people and sports media seemed to be a perfect subject."</p>
    <p>According to Spiker, sports media is in a "bigger spotlight than ever before." Not only does sports media expose the joys and ups and downs of sports, but also "now more than ever sports media exposes greater issues." Spiker mentioned Jason Collins, who recently spoke out on being gay, and Bob Costas bringing up gun control during a sport broadcast.</p>

<p><i>"Sports media has become bigger than just the games" -Ted Spiker</i></p>

<p>Sports media allows for amazing and incredible stories to be told in a way that can relate to a mass audience. Touching on the story and thematic elements, Spiker noted, "Sports serves the perfect backdrop for a narrative. We have an ending, characters, a protagonist, and then we have a lot of strong elements of storytelling." We spoke about the role that sports plays in times of tragedy, such as the JFK assassination and 9-11. "Obviously sports gives a little bit of escape that you can focus your attention on," said Spiker, "but I think its more than that because of the narrative elements. In a really genuine way, we get to see triumph. I think that's important when a nation is going through tragedy."

<p><i>"On the surface yes, it's about the ups and downs of sports but theres a lot of stuff beyond the score" -Ted Spiker</i></p>

<p>Spiker touched on issues such as access and privacy in sports media noting that we are able to get so much sports in such depth, "but you wonder where the limit is." Spiker doesn't anticipate a drop in the role of sports media and its coverage because consumer dollars support it and it provides benefits for the athlete and the organization that often outweigh any negatives.</p>

        <h3>Issues in Sports Media</h3>
        <p>While the narrative of sports media can be inspiring and enticing, various issues bring criticisms. Issues include-</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Women</li>
            <li>Privacy</li>
            <li>Money</li>
            <li>ESPN</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Women</h4>
        <p>From a professional standpoint, women have had to face a significant amount of adversity in order to achieve success. Just a mere 10% of sports journalists are women, and early stereotypes on women in the profession were extremely negative, as they were often referred to as groupies. While many women have made phenomenal careers in the sports media field, notable incidents involving athletes or other professionals have plauged the image. In 1990, Lisa Olson was reportedly approached by Zeke Mowatt as he stood naked in the locker room and the organization's owner then said that she was "asking for it." Olson was harassed by the public to the point where she received death threats, leading to her moving out of the country. In 2010, Hannah Storm was attacked by colleague Tony Kornheiser for being in an outfit that made her look like a sausage. Ines Sainz was a former TV Azteca reporter for the New York Jets. During her sideline reporting, she was receiving catcalls from players and was having footballs thrown in her direction. Women are stuck ina  double-bind. In order to join the boys, they have to be attractive, but their attractiveness becomes their own fault. The small number of incidents unfortunately reflects the majority perception. Even though NFL games have an audience of 44% women, they are underrepresented.</p>

        <h4>Privacy</h4>
        <p>Athlete privacy is a common topic in sports media. The debate on how much is too much and what details should be kept private to the athlete and/or organization remains a tough line to draw. Scandals break within minutes, often shattering an athlete's image and an organization's reputation. We see with the case of Johnny Manziel that some athletes don't want to be suffocated by media. Manziel would post pictures and behave as most college students do, but was scrutinized for his behavior when pictures when viral. While athletes do sign professional contracts and are competiting for entertainment purposes, they deamnd privacy rights too.</p>
        
        <h4>Money</h4>
        <p>The media business is all about whether or not the audience should pay for content. Even if you aren't paying directly, you might be paying indirectly. Superbowl ads cost 3.5 million dollars in 2012 for just a 30 second spot. Media makes money from subscribers, advertisers, and consumers. Higher circulation prodcuts demand more advertising dollars for the right to reach more potential customers. Much of sports media is littered with advertisments and cheesy endorsement deals like Lebron James and McDonalds. Athletes cash in on sponsorships and endorsements of those companies than advertise and sometimes make more in sponsorship dollars than their professional salaries. </p>
        
        <h4>ESPN</h4>
        <p>When we think of sports nowadays, ESPN is probably the first thing that comes to mind. Some argue that as the network has grown, journalistic standards have suffered. In terms of content, there is more dialogue and less news than in previous years. ESPN gives preferential coverage to sports they are affiliated with. ESPN doesn't have NHL rights, so hockey receives little if any coverage. In regards to the Penn State scandal, critics say that ESPN should have been leading charge in reporting on this, but they didn't. The network's relationship with celebrity athletes brings criticisms as well. Hosting "The Decision" with Lebron James and frequent appearances by non-athletes or reporters on ESPN question their credibility. They are known to be charged with plagiarism and lose their strong personalities to competing networks. The ESPN book, which interviewed nearly 500 people reveals some questionable behavior by the network and its employees.  </p>
