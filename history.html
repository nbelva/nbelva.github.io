<h3>History</h3>
    <p>Early sports media was in the form of stories. Reporters would give the news, specific game stories, analysis, questions and answers, features, investigation, opinion columns, and humor/satire. The 1960's served as the golden age of sports writing.</p>
    <p>Notable early sports media contributors include Grantland Rice, known for his poetic and inspirational prose, Red Smith, the first sportswriter to win the Pulitzer for commentary, Sam Lacy, who focused on racial equality in baseball, Dan Jenkins, dubbed the "Greatest Sportswriter in America," Frank Deford, a six time National sportswriter of the year, and Jim Murray, a 14 time sportswriter of the year. Keep in mind these are mostly reporters, the possibilities for careers in sports media has increased exponentially in recent decades. Staff is needed for media relations, community relations, social media management, and sports information among others.</p>
    <p>Television network sports picked up in the 1940's, with a dramatic increase in the 70's and 80's in terms of what networks began to pay leagues for rights to games. At this time, cable networks such as ESPN, HBO, and TBS emerged. Many universities and professional organizations now have their own sort of network that offers exclusive access for a fee. At the University of Florida, Gatorvision/Gatorzone offers coverage focused on Florida athletics.</p>
    <p>While there are many roles in sports media, the themes of sports and the underlying reasons we care about sports remains the same. Themes include <i>Man vs. Man, Good vs. Self, Man vs. Self, Boy meets Girl, David vs. Goliath, Misfit fits in, Rags to Riches, The Quest- Destination and Journey.</i></p>
